This is my repository for the CS416 Dashboard Project.

education_states.csv, race_states.csv, urban_states.csv, votes_states.csv are the cleaned data files loaded into Tableau.

The remaining csv files are the raw files. The presidential election votes file is from Harvard and the remaining are from the census. 

Data Cleaning.ipynb is the code I used to clean the files. Links to each file's original location are included there.
